    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
        be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    <img class="img-blog" src="../img/img-post1.jpg" alt="Code photo">
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.</p>
    <h2>HTML elements</h2>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
    <h3>How to link code</h3>
    <p>To link <span class="code_inline">style.css</span> to <span class="code_inline">index.html</span> add the
        following line:</p>
    <p class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main6.css"&gt;</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
        audio together with JavaScript.</p>
